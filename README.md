# cryptoreturn
simple python script for calculating ROI in crypto, with bar and interactive format

bar is designed for use with i3blocks but can be added to any status bar that can implement python

to use the interactive version, make sure you download or create the values.csv file in the same directory
use the (e)nter function to provide values
program does not presently loop so must be launched to update values
program currently accepts BTC and ETH and uses the Kraken API

feel free to modify
